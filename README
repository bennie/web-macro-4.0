web-macro-4.0
=============

Rebuilding macrophile.com

shared/  - global style templates, and robot.txt, etc
handler/ - mod_perl based auth
www/     - main site (v4.0)

A large portion of this site is static and driven off of two scripts. 
One that runs every 5 minutes and one that is run daily:

scripts/cron/daily.sh

This script updates the shell-account based user list. And outputs any 
static pages from the internal database where they are stored. In all 
cases, it only updates pages if changes are necessary.

scripts/cron/5min.sh

* This script harvests the data from the forums. 
* It generates the data for the user listings under users.macrophile.com
* It generates any new thumbnails necessary that have not been generated for art posts
* it updates the front page with links to the most recent art and stories.
* It checks the DB and writes any new static pages, if necessary.
